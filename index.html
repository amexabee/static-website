            <p class="card-text">
              The history of the World Wide Web dates back to the late 1980s
              when Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, proposed the
              concept of a global hypertext system. In 1990, he developed the
              three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of the
              web today:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-group my-5">
              <li class="list-group-item">
                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): A markup language used to
                structure and present content on the web.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The protocol that
                facilitates communication between web servers and clients.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                URL (Uniform Resource Locator): A web address used to identify
                and locate resources on the internet.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The first web page was published in 1991, and over time, the web
              gained popularity, leading to the development of web browsers such
              as Mosaic and Netscape Navigator. This sparked the growth of the
              web as individuals and organizations started creating their own
              websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              The web continued to evolve with the introduction of new
              technologies and standards. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) brought
              enhanced control over web page styling, while JavaScript allowed
              for interactive and dynamic web content. With the rise of mobile
              devices, responsive web design became crucial to provide optimal
              user experiences across different screen sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, the World Wide Web has transformed into a vast and
              interconnected network of information, services, and applications,
              playing an integral role in various aspects of our lives.
